# Text Analysis Program

This program counts the number of words, characters, sentences, paragraphs, unique words, stop words, and other text statistics for a given file. It can also generate a report of these statistics in either text or CSV format.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the following command:

python text_analysis.py <filename>


where `<filename>` is the path to the file you want to analyze.

## Output

The output of the program will be a report of the text statistics for the given file. You can save the report to a file by passing the `-o` flag to the program. For example, to save the report to a file called `report.csv`, you would run the following command:

python text_analysis.py <filename> -o report.csv


You can also specify the report format by passing the `-f` flag to the program. For example, to generate a report in CSV format, you would run the following command:

python text_analysis.py <filename> -f csv
